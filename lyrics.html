            My chest is hurting, my feet can't fall out of bed
            I don't know where to go, so I'll lay here instead
            With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread
            They all said it would fade, but again and again
            I love, I love
            I love, I love, I love
            I love, I love, I love
            I've been so busy
            But now that I'm alone
            Where did you go?
            Tell me why
            Why can't you live at home tonight and stay with me inside?
            It's nice
            Please, I wanna see what we would be if you were by my side
            Make me feel lonely, soon
            You might not know me, I wish I could lie
            But I can't deny
            My chest is hurting, my feet can't fall out of bed
            I don't know where to go, so I'll lay here instead
            With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread
            They all said it would fade, but again and again
            I love, I love
            I love, I love, I love
            I love, I love, I love
            I'm hurting, I'm stuck in my bed
            I don't know where to go, so I'll lay here instead
            With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread
            They all said it would fade, but again and again
            I love, I love
            I love, I love, I love
            I love, I love
            I love, I love, I love
