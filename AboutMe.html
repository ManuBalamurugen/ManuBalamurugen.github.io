        Hey, I'm Manu Balamurugen! I'm a Computer Science student at Rutgers University, graduating in 2028. I'm especially interested in Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence and how they connect in the real world. <br>As I progress through my major I hope to learn more about these topics and build many different projects.
        <br><br>
        Outside of my studies you'll find me working on various DIY projects, hitting the gym, or playing soccer. I enjoy staying active, learning new things, and challenging myself to keep growing. 
        <br><br>
        I'm motivated to build a career in tech, but I also hope to use my obtained skills to do more complex and fun DIY projects throughout my life.
